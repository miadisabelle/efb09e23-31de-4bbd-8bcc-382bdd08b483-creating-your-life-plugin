# Creating Your Life: Course Support Plugin

A Claude Code plugin providing agent support for the 12-week "Creating Your Life" course by Robert and Rosalind Fritz.

## What This Is

This plugin provides **8 specialized agents** that guide you through the 83-lesson course from start to finish. Each agent supports a specific aspect of learning to be a creator through structural tension methodology.

**You are not learning from these agents.** You are learning from the course itself. These agents **support your work** with the course.

## The Agents

### Foundation Agents (Use from Week 1)

**course-guide**: Navigate through all 83 lessons. Understand where you are, what the current lesson teaches, and how it connects to your overall learning.

**goal-clarifier**: Clarify what you actually want to create—not vague wishes, but specific desired outcomes. Used when setting 2-week, 1-year, and 5-year goals.

**current-reality-mapper**: See your actual current situation objectively, without judgment or problem-language. Used whenever you need to assess where you are in relation to a goal.

**structural-tension-holder**: Help hold structural tension—the conscious awareness of both desired outcome and current reality simultaneously. This is the engine of the creative process.

### Daily Practice Agent (Use throughout)

**daily-creation-coach**: Guide your 5-15 minute daily creative warm-ups. These small daily creations are the practice ground for learning how creation works, starting Week 1 and continuing through Week 12.

### Pattern Recognition Agents (Use from Week 3 onward)

**oscillating-pattern-coach**: Recognize oscillating patterns—cycles that repeat without leading to real advancement. Learn what structures generate them.

**advancing-pattern-coach**: Recognize advancing patterns—where each iteration builds on the last. Understand what makes real growth sustainable.

### Specialized Domain Agent (Use in Week 9)

**health-creator**: Apply the entire creative process framework to health. Move from "fixing what's wrong" to "creating the health you want."

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install jgwill/course-creating
```

## How to Use This Plugin

### Week 1
- Use **course-guide** to understand what Week 1 teaches

## Core Principle

These agents don't teach the course. They **support your engagement with the course itself**.

The course teaches. The agents help you do the work the course asks.

## What You'll Need

- Access to the course materials (available at [course location])
- 5-15 minutes daily for the daily creation practice
- Commitment to the 12-week progression (don't skip ahead or rearrange)
- Honesty about what you actually want to create and where you actually are

## Getting Started

1. Begin with **course-guide** to understand Week 1
2. Use **goal-clarifier** to define your first 2-week goal
3. Use **current-reality-mapper** to assess where you are
4. Start **daily-creation-coach** today
5. Let the course unfold week by week

The progression matters. Each week builds on the previous. Trust the structure.
